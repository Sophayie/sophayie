## 👋 Hi, I'm Sophie

🎓 Student in IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development  
🌿 I'm currently working on my capstone project: a remote-control application for an urban smart greenhouse.  
🧠 I'm passionate about plants — my projects often reflect that love!  
🎨 I first studied in healthcare, then in 3D design, before diving into IoT and web technologies.
